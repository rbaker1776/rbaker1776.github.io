        <h2>Course Description</h2>
        <p>Software Saturdays is a free course, sponsored by Purdue IEEE and the College of Engineering. This program is for any Purdue student who is seeking to learn a new  software development skill, spruce up their resume, or is just interested in software. Additionally, everyone can earn a College of Engineering certification upon completion. These look great on LinkedIn pages and resumes alike.</p>
        <p>
        This course offers a comprehensive introduction to modern C++ programming. You will learn the basics of C++, the core principles of object-oriented programming, memory management, and advanced features that make C++ unique. You will gain hands-on experience with the most powerful features of C++, such as smart pointers, lambda expressions, the Standard Template Library (STL), and more. By the end of the course, you’ll be equipped to write efficient, maintainable, and scalable code, and you’ll be ready to tackle real-world development challenges in C++. Whether you’re new to programming or just new to C++, this course will give you a solid foundation to become an effective software engineer.

        <h2>Course Outline</h2>

        <h3>Week 1: Introduction to C++</h3>
        <p>In the first week, you'll learn about C++'s role in modern software engineering and set up your development environment. You'll also cover the basics of C++ syntax, structure, and compiling code, and write your first simple C++ program.</p>
        
        <h3>Week 2: C++ Programming Basics</h3>
        <p>In the second week, you'll cover functions, conditionals, and control flow. You'll also learn about the concept of scope and how it relates to variable lifetimes.</p>
        
        <h3>Week 3: How C++ Works</h3>
        <p>In the third week, you'll learn about the C++ build process, memory management, pointers, and references. You'll gain a deeper understanding of how C++ works under the hood.</p>
        
        <h3>Week 4: Introduction to OOP in C++</h3>
        <p>In week 4, you'll learn about arrays, classes, and structs in C++. You'll also explore the concepts of member visibility and static members.</p>
        
        <h3>Week 5: Advanced OOP in C++</h3>
        <p>In the fifth week, you'll cover advanced object-oriented concepts, such as the principles of OOP, operator overloading, and the basics of design patterns.</p>
    
        <h3>Week 6: Templates in C++</h3>
        <p>In the sixth week, you'll be introduced to templates, which are one of the defining features of C++. You'll learn how to define function templates, class templates, as well as variadic templates and non-type template parameters (NTTPs).</p>

        <h3>Week 7: The C++ Standard Library</h3>
        <p>In week 7, you'll explore various containers, algorithms, and modules provided by the C++ standard library.</p>

        <h3>Week 8: Safety in C++</h3>
        <p>In the eighth week, you'll learn about undefined behavior, memory safety with smart pointers, and exception safety in C++.</p>

        <h3>Week 9: Compile-Time Programming</h3>
        <p>In week 9, you'll explore more advanced C++ features such as lambda expressions, compile-time programming, and an introduction to template metaprogramming.</p>
